dataset1analysis.ipynb is the analysis of dataset1.csv, available for download at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nsaravana/malware-detection?select=Malware+dataset.csv
dataset2analysis.ipynb is the analysis of dataset2.csv, available for download at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/android-malware-dataset-for-machine-learning
parameter experimentation.ipynb is the initial experimentation with analysis of the public dataset https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexandrehsd/Predicting-Pulsar-Stars/master/pulsar_stars.csv

To use the feature extraction, upload goodware and malware files to feature-extraction/drebin/my_dataset. A sample of 1 APK is already present in each directory (could not upload full directory of files used due to storage constraints). My data was drawn from the dataset CIC-AndMal2017, available at https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/andmal2017.html. Once APKs have been uploaded to each directory, run:<br>
python GetApkData.py -d my_dataset/goodware<br>
python GetApkData.py -d my_dataset/malware<br>
This will produce a .data and .xml file for each APK.

The full documentation of this extractor is available at https://github.com/Trustworthy-Software/Reproduction-of-Android-Malware-detection-approaches/tree/master/drebin.

I ran sort_data.ipynb to extract all features that were present in the Drebin 215 feature vector only and convert them to a CSV. Note that you have to manually change the last feature in output.csv (the resulting file) from label to class (['class'] conflicts with a Pandas function, so it could not be used in the script). Then, my old model was stored in run_old_model.ipynb, which I used to test on output.csv. The results are printed to the console.
